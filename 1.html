<p>I’m a few days into my stay in the United States. Here’s a rundown of the situation that led me here.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2015, I became aware that I was able to receive a green card, which would give me permanent residence in the USA.</p>

<h2 id="legal-stuff">Legal stuff</h2>

<p>Typically, when a person is a child of a US passport holder, they will also be able to receive a US passport, however, he fine print makes a <strong>distinction</strong> between those who are <em>US <strong>citizens</strong></em> and <em>US <strong>nationals</strong></em>. Citizens are nationals, but nationals are passport holders that do not have <em>‘permanent allegiance to a state [the US]’</em>.</p>

<p>That is to say, in my case, my dad as the US national, was not a US citizen, and therefore I could not automatically become one as a result of being his child.</p>

<p>So it became a case of getting a green card, i.e. <em>a permanent resident card</em>. The whole field of green cards are a very confusing thing, but it extends to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to apply for a green card <br>
<ul><li>A US national will ‘petition’ for your permanent residence; this is the person you are linked to the US to, so in my case, my father [mother, spouse, fiance(e) all available]</li></ul></li>
<li>You need to apply for an immigrant visa <br>
<ul><li>You will need to apply for this special visa and move into the US within a year of being approved for your green card</li></ul></li>
</ol>

<p>These are very much tied to each other. You may not apply for the immigrant visa without an approved green card petition, as you may not receive your green card without the visa to go and collect it. Getting into the US is not enough, you must travel in on one of these special visas to receive your card, and with it, the indefinite right (subject to the law of course) to reside there and work there.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the green card bit is a piece of cake. An approved petition can be sorted within a couple of months. The visa is a much more complicated mess. Each immigrant visa has a different preference level. Immediate relatives are considered first preference and are fast tracked through the process. Others are not so lucky and require a long wait (approximately a decade or more) before an immigrant visa becomes available, as these visas have an annual limit.</p>

<p>In my case, it turned out that while I was an unmarried minor, that is under 21 by the US laws, I would be first preference, but over 21 and I would be in a restricted category. It therefore became essential to apply beforehand.</p>

<p><strong>Important bits</strong>: <br>
- I would need to apply for a green card, as I was not eligible for citizenship. <br>
- I would have to apply for it before I became 21. <br>
- I would have to enter within a year of getting it.</p>



<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>

<p>So why do it? Well, for one, I’d never be able to get the chance again. I wouldn’t wait 10 years for the privilege and a 6 month process seemed much more interesting.</p>

<p>The second is a simultaneously selfish and selfless reason. To earn as much as I could to keep my separated and unemployable parents living well and to keep myself doing well too would be the cause to get me to go. I’m a math and computer science double major and it seems with that background and skillset, a job in the $100k starting salary world of Silicon Valley seemed an obvious fit.</p>

<p>The last is the old cliche, the American dream. I’m a person from a humble background where you only know to take what you need, so the capital of capitalism wouldn’t make an obvious choice, but they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really understand another person’s experience until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, largely I ended up going to see what the fuss was all about.</p>
